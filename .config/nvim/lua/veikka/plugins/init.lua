-- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
-- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
-- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
--    {
--        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
--        config = function()
--            require('gitsigns').setup({
--                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
--            })
--        end,
--    }
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in which-key configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

-- Remember, calling opts is the same as require().setup({})
return {
  { 'NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim', opts = {} }, -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically
}
